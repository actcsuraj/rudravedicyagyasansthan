					<p><strong>Ganesh Yagya &amp; Puja</strong></p>

					<p>Lord Ganesha is the Lord of beginnings and removers of obstacles that are constrained beyond our
						control. In that case, the help of supreme power is needed to get rid of those obstacles in
						life. Worshipping Lord Ganesha brings wisdom, and prosperity in your life and works without any
						hindrance. Whenever there is any auspicious work or event, it is first worshipped so that it can
						be completed without any hindrance. Knowledge is very important in our life. We can win or lose
						a battle because of the thinking that is required at that particular time.</p>

					<p><strong>Who should do Ganesh&nbsp;Yagya and Puja?</strong></p>

					<p>Before starting any auspicious work, Ganesh suggests Yagya, such as entering a new home, new
						company, home, shop, business, travel, etc. The disruptive Ganesha recommends a Yagya.&nbsp;
						Dedicated to Lord Ganesha the God of Wisdom and Knowledge and who gives protection and removes
						obstacles.&nbsp; This Yagya enhances the natural flow of our life and removes the physical,
						mental or emotional difficulties that we are currently facing.&nbsp;For those who are facing
						problems in life, this yagya has its importance. Even after continuous efforts when a person is
						not able to get any fruitful result, then he can perform this Ganapati Puja. For example
						frequent failures in exams, business or workplace, or difficulties in relationships. According
						to the Yagya program, the powerful Ganesh Atharva Shirsha Stotra will be recited.</p>
