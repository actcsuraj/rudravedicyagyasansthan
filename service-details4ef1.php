					<p><strong>Nakshtra &nbsp;yagya &amp; puja .</strong></p>

					<p>According to the Hindu calendar, there are 27 Nakshatras. In this, some constellations give
						auspicious results, while some give inauspicious results. It is very necessary to pacify those
						who are inauspicious constellations. Whenever a person is born on this earth, he is born with
						certain characteristics like date of birth, time of birth and place of birth. His fate as
						decided by God is revealed by the horoscope, how will his fate be? When a person is born, the
						Moon and other planets have their special zodiac signs. Nakshatras and planets etc. have a very
						deep effect on a person&#39;s life. Apart from these planets, there are 27 constellations and
						divisions of the lunar path. Sometimes, this inauspicious constellation causes miseries in a
						person&#39;s life. All this happens because of the bad effects of the Nakshatras in which the
						person is born. This effect affects the physical appearance and future of the person. The birth
						star determines the destiny and also controls the subconscious aspects of the personality.
						Nakshatra Shanti Puja should be performed every year on the birth constellation for protection
						and better results. Nakshatra Puja includes Jeevan Havan, Mrityunjay Havan, Navagraha Dosha,
						Graha Shanti Puja, and Sapta Chiranjeevi Puja Yahavan.<br />
						<br />
						&nbsp;
					</p>

					<p><strong>Who should do&nbsp; Nakshatra Yagya and Puja?</strong></p>

					<p>The purpose of Nakshatra Shanti Puja is to remove the effects of inauspicious constellations at
						the time of birth of a person. When an inauspicious Nakshatra affects a person to such an extent
						that he is unable to recover from its effects, then Nakshatra Shanti Puja should be performed.
						It is told in the scriptures that the presiding deities of the constellations are pacified
						through Nakshatra Shanti Puja. &nbsp;According to Vedic astrology, if a child is born in
						Ashwini, Revathi, Magha, Ashlesha, Moola, and Jyestha Nakshatra, then Gandmool doshas are
						found.&nbsp; It gives bad results for the child.&nbsp; This yagya is done for the safety of the
						child born.&nbsp; We highly recommend this Yagya.</p>
