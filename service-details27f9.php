					<p><strong>Durga yagya &amp; puja.</strong></p>

					<p>Maha Durga Puja is a symbol of Maa Durga. Maa Durga is the destroyer of tragedies, ignorance and
						other ill effects of life. It helps in peace and spiritual attainment in life. This Durga Puja
						is very beneficial to ward off imminent danger, court cases and political litigation. Our
						special Pandits and Acharyas working under the able guidance of our team of astrologers perform
						this Yagya as per the instructions given in Durga Saptarishi, a part of Markandeya Puranas. Maa
						Durga is considered the divine destroyer of accidents, tragedies, sufferings as well as
						ignorance.<br />
						&nbsp;</p>

					<p><strong>Who should do Durga&nbsp;Yagya and Puja?</strong></p>

					<p>Divine blessings of Goddess Durga, give life a successful, divine energy. Maa Durga frees them
						from all the difficulties which become obstacles on the path of your life.&nbsp; This is a very
						powerful yagya.&nbsp; We highly recommend this Yagya. Durga, in Sanskrit, means &quot;one who is
						incomprehensible or difficult to reach.&quot; Goddess Durga is a form of Shakti who is
						worshipped for her kind and terrifying aspect. Mother of the universe, she represents the
						infinite power of the universe and is a symbol of female dynamism. It is said that the
						manifestation of Goddess Durga emanates from her formless essence and the two are inseparable.
						Goddess Durga is present since eternity, always residing in her sweet nature and residing in the
						hearts and minds of her ardent devotees. As Shakti Shakti, she shapes, nourishes and dissolves
						names and forms, while as a subtle spiritual energy called Kundalini, she lights the lotus for
						the seven centres of awareness in the sacred human body. Goddess Durga killed the mighty demon
						Mahisha and all his great generals. When demonic forces create imbalance then all the deities
						unite to become one divine force called Shakti or Durga.</p>
