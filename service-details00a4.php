					<p><strong>kuber yagya &amp; puja.</strong></p>

					<p>Kuber Puja is a very auspicious puja to get the blessings of Kuber Dev, the god of wealth and
						treasurer, which proves beneficial to be performed on the day of Diwali. According to
						mythology, Goddess Lakshmi resides at the same place where Kubera is worshipped. Worshipping
						Kubera on the night of Diwali solves all kinds of money-related
						problems.https://www.watchbestuk.me/&nbsp;</p>

					<p><strong>&nbsp;Who should do kuber &nbsp;Yagya and Puja?</strong></p>

					<p>Lord Kubera is the god of wealth, according to mythology, Lord Shiva made Kubera the god of
						wealth.&nbsp; Lord Kubera&#39;s blessings bring good luck, prosperity, good income and
						better business.&nbsp; Worshipping Kubera is very fruitful.&nbsp; Apart from this, Lord
						Kubera is also considered the god of jewellery and it is said that if you are surrounded by
						money related problems then you can overcome all the problems related to wealth by
						worshipping Kubera Ji.&nbsp; If you want to achieve success in your business, then you
						should also order Kuber Yagya.&nbsp; Kuber is the king of the Yakshas and the lord of wealth
						in Hindu mythology. He is also known as Dhanapati, the lord of riches. He is one of the
						Guardians of the directions, representing the Uttara-disha, meaning north of 4 directions in
						Sanskrit. Kuber is also the son of Sage Vishrava (hence he is also called Vaisravana) and in
						this respect, he is also the elder brother of the Lord of Lanka, Ravana. He is said to have
						performed austerities for a thousand years, in reward for which Brahma, the Creator, gave
						him immortality and made him the god of wealth, guardian of all the treasures of the earth,
						the Nidhi which he was to give out to whom they were destined. When Brahma appointed him God
						of Riches, he gave him Lanka (Ceylon) as his capital, and presented him, according to the
						Ramayana, with the vehicle pushpaka, which was immense and &lsquo;moved at the owner&rsquo;s
						will at marvellous speed&rsquo;. When Ravana captured Lanka, Kuber moved to his city of
						Alaka, and established his Yaksha Kingdom there.</p>
