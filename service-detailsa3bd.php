					<p><big><strong>Mahalakshmi yagya &amp; puja </strong></big></p>

					<p><big>Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, is the power and consort of the powerful- Vishnu, the
							protector, is the power in her absolute plurality. Sri or Lakshmi, is depicted in the Vedas
							as the goddess of wealth and fortune, power and beauty. According to the Puranas, she was
							the daughter of sage Bhrigu and his wife Khyati. She was later born from the Kshir Sagar
							(the ocean of milk), while the more popular churning was known as Samudra Manthan. Hence,
							his appeal, &quot;Ksheer sea king Tanay&quot;. Vishnu represents all that is male and
							Lakshmi, all that is female. Lakshmi is seductively beautiful, and standing on a lotus seat
							holding a lotus, with a garland of the lotus called Padma, or Kamala.</big></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p><big><strong>&nbsp;Who should do Mahalakshmi &nbsp;Yagya and Puja?</strong></big></p>

					<p><big>Mahalakshmi is the goddess of wealth and prosperity.&nbsp; Order Mahalaxmi Yagya for wealth,
							prosperity, financial development etc.&nbsp; This yagya includes 1 yagya which helps to
							strengthen your karma.&nbsp; Because it is a Vedic process.&nbsp; Karma will be good only
							then you can get wealth and prosperity through the blessings of Mahalakshmi.&nbsp; This is a
							very impressive yagya, we highly recommend this yagya.&nbsp; When Lakshmi is worshipped in a
							temple, she is shown seated on a lotus throne holding Padma, conch shell, Amrit Kalash (a
							pot of nectar) and Bilva fruit in four hands. Her four hands (Clever Vidha) symbolize her
							power to confer four types of Purushartha (end of human life), Dharma (righteousness), Artha
							(wealth), Kama (desires), and Moksha (blessed). Bow and arrow, mace and chakra are combined
							in the image of Mahalakshmi. If her skin is white, she represents the purest form of
							Prakriti (Prakriti) from which the universe evolved. Since she is the mother of all, the
							pink colour signifies her compassion towards living beings. Only Lakshmi temples are rare;
							He is complete with Vishnu or Narayana as if without His manifestation they are ineffective.
							It is said that if one chants the 108 names of Lakshmi, harmony and prosperity become the
							constant companions of the devotee. He is complete with Vishnu or Narayana as if without His
							manifestation they are ineffective.</big><br />
