					<p><strong>Chandra&nbsp;Yagya &amp; Puja.</strong></p>

					<p>&nbsp;Moon is a cold planet. &nbsp;It is the lord of the Cancer zodiac and represents Rohini,
						Hasta and Shravan Nakshatras. &nbsp;Moon is the factor of feminine nature and possesses royal
						qualities. &nbsp;Moon is exalted in Taurus and debilitated in Scorpio. &nbsp;The friendly
						planets are Sun and Mercury. &nbsp;Moon gives complete vision to the seventh house from its
						position. &nbsp;He travels on a zodiac for two and a half days. &nbsp;Moon gives quick results
						due to the quick change of the zodiac. &nbsp;The Dasha year of the moon is 10.</p>

					<p><strong>&nbsp;Who should do Moon Yagya and Puja?</strong></p>

					<p>when the dasha year comes, many times changes are seen like a man. &nbsp;When the Moon does not
						give us fruit, and when the Moon affects a particular area in the horoscope, we especially (the
						moon) recommend Chandra Yagya. &nbsp;Chandra Yagya is performed to pacify the moon and
						strengthen the area affected by the moon. &nbsp;Moon represents the mind. &nbsp;It reflects
						thoughts and feelings, the complex psychological faculties that take energy from the senses, and
						the way the body responds. &nbsp;Moon is the most important planet in Vedic astrology as the
						state of mind is responsible for all the emotional reactions of life, and hence defines the
						subjective perception of life. &nbsp;Circumstances affecting the Moon in astrology affect
						thinking and feeling processes, mental skills and attitude. &nbsp;When Moon is benefic it gives
						good family life, a high position in public life, manners, and friendly nature.
						&nbsp;Spontaneous and pleasing personality, magnetism, desire for wealth and worldly things,
						interest in mental subjects and taste of all delicious fruits, gives good relation with mother,
						travels abroad etc. &nbsp;When Moon is afflicted, it makes the native unfortunate, ill in
						infancy and old age, fickle mind, perverted, impulsive, over-anxious, timid tendencies, obscene,
						grainy, gloomy and pessimistic and lack mental peace. &nbsp;So you can perform this Yagya to
						reduce the negative symptoms and enhance the positive results. &nbsp;We highly recommend Chandra
						Yagya. &nbsp;Impulsive, hyper-anxious, timid tendencies, vulgar, grainy, sad and pessimistic and
						lacking peace of mind. &nbsp;So you can perform this Yagya to reduce the negative symptoms and
						enhance the positive results. &nbsp;We highly recommend Chandra Yagya. &nbsp;Impulsive,
						hyper-anxious, timid tendencies, vulgar, grainy, sad and pessimistic and lacking peace of mind.
						&nbsp;So you can perform this Yagya to reduce the negative symptoms and enhance the positive
						results. &nbsp;We highly recommend Chandra Yagya.</p>
