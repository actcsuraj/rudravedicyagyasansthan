					<p><strong>Kalsarp dosh yagya &amp; puja .</strong></p>

					<p>Kaal Sarp Dosh in Kundli creates many problems in a person&#39;s life like marriage problems,
						financial problems, love problems, job or business problems etc. Prevention of Kaal Sarp Yoga is
						done by worship. &#39;Kaal Sarp Dosh&#39; is a misdemeanor, if it is in the horoscope, then the
						life of the person faces struggles one after the other. At present, a lot of confusion and doubt
						is being created about Kalsarp. The main reason behind this is the lack of authentic information
						about the validity of this defect, due to which some people do not recognize it.</p>

						highly recommend this Yagya. Those who have performed some rituals in the name of its peace also
						seem to be questioning the Kaal Sarp Dosh. His reasoning behind this is that there is no profit
						even after peace. There is some confusion associated with the calmness of Kaal Sarp Dosh as it
						is necessary to have peace at a particular place. According to us &quot;Kaal Sarp Dosh&quot;
						peace can happen at any place. To avoid the negative consequences of Kaal Sarp Dosh, since Vedic
						times, the Kalsarp Dosh Shanti ritual is the only way. In the Vedic period, Kalsarp Dosh Shanti
						Puja was specially performed, and special attention is paid to performances, Havan Samadhi, etc.
						so that the negative effects of Kaal Sarp Dosh can be minimized as much as
						possible<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Kaal Sarp Dosh Shanti Puja is highly beneficial and can help in
						reducing the dire consequences of Kaal Sarp Dosh. The most auspicious time to perform this puja
						is on the new moon day falling on Wednesday. Shanti Puja of Kaal Sarp Dosh can prove to be
						extremely powerful to reduce the intensity of Kaal Sarp Dosh and bring a great amount of solace
						and relief to the person.</p>
