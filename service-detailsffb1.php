					<p><strong>&nbsp;Mangal Yagya &amp; Puja.</strong><br />
						&nbsp;Mars is a mighty planet. &nbsp;It represents Mrigashira, Chitra, and Dhanishta Nakshatra,
						the lord of Aries and Scorpio. &nbsp;Mars is the malefic planet, the working style is that of
						the commander. &nbsp;Mars is exalted in Capricorn and debilitated by Cancer. &nbsp;The friendly
						planets of Mars are Sun, Moon and Jupiter. &nbsp;Mars is aspecting the fourth and eighth house
						along with the seventh from its place. &nbsp;Mars travels in one sign for 18 months. &nbsp;The
						Dasha of Mars is year 7.<br />
						&nbsp;</p>

					<p><strong>&nbsp;Who should do Mars Yagya and Puja?</strong></p>

					<p>When Mars does not give us unfavorable results, and when Mars affects a particular area in the
						horoscope, we suggest Mangal Shanti Yagya. &nbsp;(Mangal Shanti Yagya) is performed to remove
						the areas and obstacles affected by the planet Mars. &nbsp;Mars in particular represents energy,
						ability, courage, and strength. &nbsp;Mars represents ways of harnessing energy on many
						different levels. &nbsp;It acts as physical energy in the body. &nbsp;In the social sphere, Mars
						represents relationships that test for strength, such as competition, enemies, etc. &nbsp;Mars
						represents and affects the areas of blood, head, neck, menstruation, pitta imbalance, flammable
						products, residential property, security, military, etc. &nbsp;Mars gives auspicious decisions,
						planning, ability, courage, integrity, stamina etc. &nbsp;Inauspicious Mars is attracted towards
						conflict, conflict, violence, youth, and emotion. &nbsp;You (Mangal Shanti) can opt for Mangal
						Shanti Yagya to increase auspicious results and reduce inauspicious results. &nbsp;We highly
						recommend Mangal Yagya.</p>
