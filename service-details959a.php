					<p><strong>Pitra dosh &nbsp;Yagya Puja.</strong></p>

					<p>In Indian Vedic astrology, Pitra Dosh Puja occurs when there is a conjunction of Sun and Rahu in
						the ninth house or a bad position of the ninth house or the Sun or the ninth house is under the
						influence of malefic planets like Saturn, Rahu and Ketu. The concept of Pitru Dosha Puja is held
						about it being one of the most important rituals to neutralize the ill effects of this dosha.
					</p>

					<p>It is believed that if Pitra Dosh Puja is not performed or due priority is not given to
						neutralize it, then the life of a person becomes full of different misfortunes. Hence, it is
						performed to seek the blessings of the departed ancestors and to make one&#39;s karmic structure
						positively refined and powerful. https://www.icosplayshop.com/</p>

					<p><strong>&nbsp;Who should do pitra dosh &nbsp;Yagya and Puja?</strong></p>

					<p>As the name suggests, fatherhood is the reason why proper Shradh Karma is not performed due to
						problems in the house of our ancestors. Whether there is Pitra Dosh or not, is also revealed by
						the horoscope of the human being. Its direct method is that if any planet of Rahu-Ketu is
						sitting with Sun or Moon in the horoscope, then it is called Pitra Dosha.</p>

					<p>Sun is called father in astrology; Moon is called mother. If there is Rahu or Ketu with any one
						of these two planets then these planets get corrupted. This is called Pitra Dosh. If there is
						Pitra Dosha then many problems arise. For their peace, Pitru Dosh Shanti Puja is performed, in
						which all known or unknowing ancestors are worshipped.</p>

					<p>When our ancestors see their family with a subtle body, and realize that their family members do
						not show respect to them nor have any affection or love, nor do they remember them on any
						occasion. Huh. Nor do they try to repay their debt, and then these souls become unhappy and
						curse their descendants, which is called &quot;Pitri Dosha&quot;.</p>

					<p>Pitru Dosh Shanti Puja is an invisible obstacle. This obstacle is caused by the war of ancestors.
						There can be many reasons for the dissatisfaction of the ancestors, due to your conduct, any
						mistake made by the family while performing the Shradh, etc., due to some error in the funeral
						rituals.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;<strong>Benefits of pitra dosh Yagya and Puja.</strong></p>

					<ul>
						<li>Remedial worship against the curse of one&#39;s late ancestor.</li>
						<li>&nbsp;It can also mean a remedy against the evil deeds of the departed ancestors and their
							effects which are also present in the present life of their descendants.</li>
						<li>Worship is performed by a person to neutralize the Pitru curse.</li>
						<li>&nbsp;After Pitra Dosh Puja, the soul of the departed ancestor becomes calm to attain
							salvation and the person receives the blessings of ancestors from heaven.</li>
						<li>If the person faces complications in having a baby or frequent miscarriages</li>
						<li>Is there any regular financial problem and huge debt in the family</li>
						<li>The person who is constantly failing in her career and academic life</li>
