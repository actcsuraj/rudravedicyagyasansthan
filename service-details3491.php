					<p><strong>Rahu &nbsp;shanti yagya &amp; puja </strong></p>

					<p>You all must have heard the name of Rahu. Rahu is a shadow planet. According to the Hindu
						religion, Rahu is the severed head of an Asura, which eclipses the Sun or the Moon at the time
						of an eclipse. Today we will tell you about Rahu Puja. Rahu&#39;s dasha harms the native in any
						case. Rahu is not a planet but the shadow of the planet. The shadow of the earth or the shadow
						falling on the earth. Rahu is the severed head of the demon who drank the nectar fraudulently in
						the form of a deity. By then the drops of nectar had gone down the throat, due to which the head
						i.e. Rahu and Ketu i.e. torso had become immortal.<br />
						&nbsp;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p><strong>Who should do Rahu Yagya and Puja?</strong></p>

					<p>When Rahu does not give us favorable results, and when Rahu obstructs a particular area in the
						horoscope, Rahu suggests a peace Yagya.&nbsp; Rahu peace Yagya is done to remove the areas and
						obstacles affected by Rahu.&nbsp; Rahu is a fundamental difference between other planets.&nbsp;
						Other planets are bodies with physical mass whose size, colour, gravity, atmosphere, speed
						etc.&nbsp; There are only sensitive points on the planet Rahu where the Moon&#39;s orbit blocks
						the path of the Sun.&nbsp; They give the influence of the lord of the zodiac where they are
						positive or the planets with which they are associated. &nbsp;Rahu has the qualities of
						Saturn.&nbsp; Internally Rahu is a shadowy planet, representing desires, mystics, and
						illusions.&nbsp; It deceives and shows immoral acts, misunderstanding, and lack of
						judgment.&nbsp; Physically Rahu behaves as a Saturn, causing its weak and afflicted condition
						and fatal growth during transit, wounds and skin problems, ulcers, spleen, worms, high blood
						pressure, chronic problems, nightmares.&nbsp; The positive and negative effects of Rahu have a
						profound impact on human life and have been very well documented in our ancient sacred texts and
						the adverse planet Rahu can cause all kinds of problems, interruptions, failures, sickness and
						confusion.&nbsp; Which can be very pathetic for life.&nbsp; Even when the planet Rahu is with
						planets like Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Moon and Sun, it creates various bad yogas which can result
						in all kinds of troubles in a person&#39;s life.&nbsp; You can choose Rahu Yagya to remove the
						negative signs of Rahu.&nbsp; We highly recommend Rahu Peace Yagya.</p>

					<p><strong>Note</strong>: - Before performing the Rahu Yagya, you need to check the role of the Rahu
						in your horoscope.&nbsp; How is the Rahu for you&nbsp; If it is auspicious, is it capable of
						(giving) results in your life in its represented area?&nbsp; If this is inauspicious for you,
						what areas of your life are hindered and harmful to you? &nbsp;After knowing this one can
						request a Rahu Yagya.</p>
