					<h2><strong>Shiva Special Yagya in the month of Sawan, offer Belpatra to Lord Shiva.</strong></h2>

					<p>The holy month of Sawan has started and according to the Hindu calendar, today is the first
						Monday fast, on this day devotees keep fast and offer Dhatura made from cow milk, Belpatra,
						Bhang and flowers to Lord Shiva. According to mythology, offering Belpatra to Lord Shiva is
						considered auspicious and according to experts, if Belpatra is offered in the right way, then it
						also fulfills wishes. Let us tell you the right way to offer Belpatra, their importance and
						whether they are really healthy for human consumption or not.</p>

					<p>According to mythology, during Samudra Manthan, when the gods and demons churned the ocean, many
						things came out during this process and one of them was poison. To save the world, Lord Shiva
						drank this poison, but the effect of the poison was so intense that he became restless. To
						control the burning sensation in the throat, God fed him Belpatra, as it has properties to
						reduce the effect of poison. Since then, Bel Patra became an integral part of the offerings made
						to Lord Shiva.</p>

					<p>According to experts and mythology, three joined leaves in sets of 3 to 11 should be offered to
						the Shivling and 108 Bel Patra should be offered for speedy marriage. It is suggested to wash
						the leaves thoroughly and ensure that the leaves do not have any odour and there are no stains
						or cuts in the leaves. While offering the leaves to Lord Shiva, the smooth side should be placed
						on the Shivling and writing Om Namah Shivaya on the other side with kumkum or sandalwood is
						considered auspicious. Not only are religious sentiments attached to the holy leaves, but they
						are also good for the human body due to their medicinal properties.</p>

					<h2><strong>Significange of Bel-Patra.</strong></h2>

					<p>You may also be interested in knowing about the diverse uses of Bel Patra &ndash; as a medicine,
						as a face pack to cure skin problems, or as a refreshment to be consumed during summers. Bel
						Patra has very unique medicinal benefits. Its fruit is a rich source of vitamins and minerals
						including vitamin C, vitamin A, riboflavin, calcium, potassium, fibre, vitamins B1, B6 and B12
						&ndash; which are essential for the overall growth and development of the body. According to
						Ayurveda, there are three doshas &ndash; Vata, Pitta and Kapha, and consuming Bel Patra helps
						balance all the three doshas. Bel fruit contains antioxidants and has laxative properties that
						help cure stomach-related ailments like diarrhoea, dysentery, vomiting; it also strengthens the
						digestive system. Consuming bel patra helps to control lifestyle diseases like diabetes, high
						blood pressure, heart problems and cholesterol.</p>

						bel patra mixture for a few days will reduce body odour. Eating or drinking bel patra juice can
