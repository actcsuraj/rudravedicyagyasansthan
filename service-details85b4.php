					<p><strong>Shani shanti yagya &amp; puja </strong></p>

					<p>Shani Dev never troubles people needlessly. Nothing comes to us that we do not deserve. None can
						escape the clutches of the karmic cycle meaning what we do comes back to us sometimes.
						Therefore, it is not proper to condemn Shani Dev for what we suffer. When we repent for our past
						bad deeds and desire to correct ourselves, Shani Dev is highly pleased and blesses us.<br />
						&nbsp;</p>

					<p><strong>Who should do shani Yagya and Puja?</strong></p>

					<p>&nbsp;When Saturn does not give us favourable results, and when Saturn obstructs any particular
						area in the horoscope, saturn suggests a peaceful Yagya.&nbsp; Saturn peace Yagya is performed
						to remove the affected areas and obstacles from peace.&nbsp; Saturn represents grief, Saturn in
						the horoscope is a very important and sometimes profound spiritual influence.&nbsp; Saturn is
						the symbol of everything which is deeply long-lasting and serious in life.&nbsp; It is
						associated with all aspects of life which teaches a person to be more thoughtful and
						practical.&nbsp; Saturn is considered a male planet.&nbsp; Suffering, plagues, death, travel,
						age, enslavement, sculpture, weapons and detachments are represented by Saturn.&nbsp; A person
						whose Saturn is weak in its horoscope, has to go through sufferings throughout his life and his
						hard work also slows down his progress.&nbsp; If Saturn is favourable then it can achieve very
						good success, name and fame in his business career, especially in those areas which are ruled by
						an industry like Saturn.&nbsp; When Saturn is not in good position in the horoscope, it causes
						many problems, accidents, conflicts, poor financial condition, unhappiness, sadness, depression,
						poverty etc.&nbsp; In such circumstances, Saturn Yagya can bring peace and comfort.&nbsp; This
						Saturn indicates responsibility, longevity, justice, and continuation.&nbsp; Conflict, hard work
						with little remuneration.&nbsp; Physically Saturn governs the joints, knees, nervous system, and
						nerves of the body.&nbsp; During its weakened and afflicted condition and infection, there is a
						chronic and painful disease, leg fractures, cancer, paralysis, flatulence or gout
						imbalance.&nbsp; The auspicious Saturn gives good qualities like endurance, economy, frugality
						and patience and perseverance, mystery-keeping power, stability, stability, self-control, a
						sense of duty to God and man, accuracy, and caution in all matters.&nbsp; It develops into a
						personal truth, the power of charity, meditation and concentration, honesty, prudence, penance
						etc.&nbsp; Inauspicious Saturn causes delays, frustrations, anorexia, disputes, differences,
						mistrust etc. in work.&nbsp; This relentless uphill conflict, sorrow and despair.&nbsp; This
						makes the native drunkard, gambler, lazy and lethargic.&nbsp; you can do this Yagya to reduce
						negative symptoms and increase positive results.&nbsp; We highly recommend Saturn Yagya.</p>

					<p><strong>Note:</strong> - Before performing the Saturn Yagya, you need to check the role of Saturn
						in your horoscope.&nbsp; How is the Saturn for you&nbsp; If it is auspicious, is it capable of
						(giving) results in your life in its represented area?&nbsp; If this is inauspicious for you,
						what areas of your life are hindered and harmful to you?&nbsp; After knowing this one can
						request a Saturn Yagya</p>
