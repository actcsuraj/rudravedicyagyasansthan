					<p><strong>Surya Yagya &amp; Puja.</strong></p>

					<p>&nbsp;Sun is an energetic planet. &nbsp;It is the lord of the Leo zodiac and represents Kritika,
						Uttaraphalguni and Uttarashada constellations. &nbsp;Sun is a male planet by nature and
						possesses the qualities of a king. &nbsp;Sun is exalted in the Aries sign Libra is debilitated.
						&nbsp;The friendly planets are Moon, Mars and Jupiter. &nbsp;The Sun is aspecting the seventh
						house from its position. &nbsp;It travels on one zodiac sign for a month. &nbsp;The Dasha of the
						Sun is year 6. &nbsp;<br />
						&nbsp;</p>

					<p><strong>&nbsp;Who should do Sun Yagya and Puja?</strong></p>

					<p>When the Sun does not give us the results according to us, and when the planets affect a
						particular area in the horoscope, the Sun planets offer Yagya. &nbsp;Surya Yagya is performed
						for the peace of the Sun and the areas affected by the Sun. The Sun represents the soul.
						&nbsp;The word soul is used for the ultimate meaning of the most profound and complex nature,
						identity, inspiration and aspiration. &nbsp;The Sun reflects the self-ego, self-respect, and
						sense of purpose of a person. &nbsp;The Sun represents our tendency, ability and talent to act
						as a leader or authority. &nbsp;(Surya) Surya Yagya is performed to strengthen the Sun and
						remove negative symptoms. &nbsp;When Sun is afflicted, it makes a person arrogant, mean,
						irritable, jealous, angry, temperamental, immoral etc. &nbsp;The Sun physically governs the
						body, brain, bones, and aspect of the right eye. &nbsp;We highly recommend Surya Yagya.</p>

						field of representation in your life? &nbsp;Or not? &nbsp;If it is unlucky for you, which areas
						of your life are disrupted and harmful to you? &nbsp;If it is unlucky for you, which areas of
