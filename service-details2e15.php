					<h2><strong>Tuladan &nbsp;yagya &amp; puja.</strong></h2>

					<p>Tuladan Leela is also included in the pastimes of Lord Krishna. It is believed that Lord
						Krishna has told us about the importance of Tulsi in this Tuladan Leela. Inspired by this
						Tuladan Leela, along with Lord Dwarkadhish, another temple was built which was known as
						Tuladan Mandir. According to the sacred texts, Tula Dan, also known as Mahadan, is one of
						the major ancient rituals of Sanatan Dharma. This ritual is highly recommended for those who
						are suffering from health issues, Griha dosha, Pitra dosha or any other obstruction. By
						donating Libra every problem is solved and salvation is attained. Here Tula means scale of
						weight and Dan means charity. According to the belief and remedy, the devotee for whom the
						Libra is donated in this ritual should sit on one side of the Libra and the other side
						should keep food items like grains, sugar, ghee, gold etc.</p>

					<p><strong>Who should do tuladan &nbsp;Yagya and Puja?</strong></p>

					<p>A large number of legends are popular about the Tula Dan ritual. According to a prominent
						legend in Dwarka Puri, Satyabhama (a queen of Lord Dwarkadhish) wanted to be closest to Lord
						Krishna&#39;s heart. He had donated Lord Krishna to Narada Muni. After realizing the
						mistakes he requested Narada Muni to solve this situation. Then Narnamuni explains this
						ritual. In which they have to donate gold or other material equal to the weight of
						Dwarkadhish. Queen Satyabhama decided to perform this ritual and tried to weigh Lord Krishna
						with gold but she could not do it even after having so much gold. Thereafter, Queen Rukmani
						(an incarnation of Goddess Mahalakshmi) advises him to plant a Tulsi leaf with pure
						devotion. After this, the ritual of Tuladan is performed. According to some texts, Lord Shri
						Krishna also performed this Tula donation ritual to save his son Samba from the curse of
						Brahmins. According to another legend, after the Kurukshetra war between the Pandavas and
						the Kauravas, King Yudhishthira and his brothers also performed this ritual by killing their
						relatives to get rid of the sins they had committed.</p>

					<p><strong>Benefits of tuladan Yagya and Puja.</strong></p>

					<p>It is said about Tuladan that by doing this donation, all the planets are donated. According
						to astrology, every part of our body is affected by some or the other planet and by donating
						Tula, donations are made for all the planets. In this way, whatever planet&#39;s fault is on
						you, it gets removed. The person who donates Tula&#39;s health remains good and he gets
						happiness and prosperity. Tuladan is also mentioned in mythology. It is said that Tuladan is
						equal to a great donation. Whoever does this charity, attains Vishnu Lok. In ancient times,
						people of the affluent classes used to donate gold with gold. Tuladan is also done with
						grains now. It is believed that at the behest of Lord Vishnu, Lord Brahma had made a Libra
						donation to decide the importance of the pilgrimages. Tuladan is said to be equivalent to
						pilgrimage. If a person cannot undertake the pilgrimage, then he can also get equal merit
						from the donation of Libra.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>According to the Puranas, Vishnulok is attained by performing Tuladan rituals.</li>
						<li>It also helps in attaining salvation.</li>
						<li>Donating Libra in Dwarka has the same benefits as donating all nine planets.</li>
						<li>Performing this ritual helps to remove the negative effects of any planet and planetary
							defects.</li>
						<li>It helps to improve health and cure serious diseases.</li>
						<li>This ritual helps a person to progress spiritually as well.</li>
						<li>In short, performing Tuladan ritual helps in a long life, success, name, fame, strength,
							happiness, wealth etc.</li>
