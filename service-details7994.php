					<p><strong>Bhairav</strong><strong> yagya &amp; puja.</strong></p>

					<p>The Maha Kaal Bhairava Enemy Destruction Mantra is one of the most destructive of the Indian
						Tantric Mantras for eradicating enemies. This is an out-and-out Tamas Mantra and is not to be
						practised if you are not an experienced Tantric. The purpose of this Prayog is to invoke
						Bhairava to destroy your enemy. In the path of life the basic two obstacle creator enemies are
						certain problems and unexpected accidents. If these main two obstacles are not there in life; a
						person can have a good hold over the progress of material and spiritual life. The movement of
						time is infinite and runs continuously. This resulting us in present to term going off as
						&lsquo;past&rsquo; and expected as &lsquo;future&rsquo;. But every incident is pre-placed in the
						motion of time and when you reach that particular point of the time it comes in front of you as
						&lsquo;Present&rsquo;. This way in our life if any situation is there or arriving situations all
						those were prearranged in the time as a result enforced with karma.&nbsp;</p>

					<p><strong>Who should do </strong><strong>Bhairav</strong><strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yagya and
							Puja?</strong></p>

					<p>Lord Bhairav ​​is worshipped in Tantra Vidya. Bhairav ​​is considered to be an incarnation of

						trident, khaddar, Thapar and around, as well as his vehicle is a dog. He is considered to be the
						lord of ghosts and yoginis. In Kali Yuga, one has to face obstacles, troubles and enemies every
						step of the way. In such a situation, chanting mantra remains the only way through which you can
						get victory over your problems and enemies. It is also described in the scriptures that by
						installing and worshipping Bhairav ​​Yantra, all obstacles are removed.</p>
