					<p>The Maha Mrityunjaya mantra was founded (or given by Lord Shiva) by sage Markandeya. This mantra

						problem. It is a combination of three Hindi words i.e. &quot;Maha&quot; which means great,
						&quot;Mrityu&quot; meaning death and &quot;Jaya&quot; meaning victory which translates into
						victory over death.<br />
