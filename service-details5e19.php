					<p>Special worship on Monday and Friday. 24 and 28 july 2023.<br />
						<br />
						On this Monday we are organizing a special Pooja Yagya of Vedic scholar Lord Shiva. In this
						Yagya, 1008 Vilva leaves will be worshiped on Lord Shiva. Belpatra is called Belpatra or
						Bilvapatra. Belpatra has three leaves joined together. Shiva&#39;s worship is not complete
						without Belpatra, Belpatra is very dear to Lord Shiva. There is such a belief about belpatra
						that Lord Shankar&#39;s brain remains cool with belpatra and water. Velpatra is very dear to
						Lord Shiva. By offering Wilpatra to Lord Shiva, the sins of many births are removed.<br />
						<br />
						Belpatra reduces the effect of poison so the gods and goddesses started giving them belpatra to
						reduce their irritation and Mahadev started chewing belpatra.<br />
						<br />
						During this, water was also offered to keep his head cool. Due to the effect of belpatra and
						water, the heat generated in Bholenath&#39;s body calmed down. After this he also got a name
						Neelkanth. Since then the tradition of offering water and belpatra to Lord Shiva started.<br />
						<br />
						Yagya during hour.<br />
						<br />
						1 hour<br />
						<br />
						Yagya donation.<br />
						<br />
						Per day $21.00<br />

						Benefits of offering Vilvapatra to Lord Shiva.<br />

						Fulfillment of desire power.<br />
