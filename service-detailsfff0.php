					<p><strong>Gandmool dosh Yagya Puja.</strong></p>

					<p>The concept of Gandmool Nakshatra Dosha refers to the astronomical phenomenon when the
						fast-moving planet Moon is situated in Gandmool Nakshatra at the time of birth. Thus, whenever
						the Moon is placed in any of the 6 Nakshatras of Mercury and Ketu, namely Ashwini, Ashlesha,
						Magha, Jyeshtha, Mool and Revati, Gandmool Nakshatra Dosha Shanti Puja is required.

					<p>It is believed that if a child is born in Gand Mool Nakshatra, then the natives &ndash; parents,
						siblings and relatives may have to face serious side effects (even death) due to this dosha.
						Along with this, the person may have to face serious physical and mental problems. The native
						will have bad/toxic relationships and financial problems throughout his life.</p>

						days from the date of birth of the native. Also, if for some reason the ritual is not performed
						within the recommended time frame, it can be extended to 27 months or 27 years. However, the
						recommended time frame to get maximum positive benefits from Gandmool Nakshatra Dosha Nivaran
						Puja is within 27 days.</p>
