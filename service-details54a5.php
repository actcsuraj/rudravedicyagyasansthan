					<p><strong>Gayatri</strong><strong> yagya &amp; puja.</strong></p>

					<p>The Almighty God may illuminate our intellect, which may lead us on the righteous path. A person
						can proceed rapidly on the path of soul growth and self-realization through devotion of the
						Goddess Gayatri the supreme creative energy of the divine. It endows its devotee with true
						wisdom. A subtle, uninterrupted current of divine energy starts flowing through the inner being
						of the devotee, cleansing his intellect, mind and emotions of the perverse, perverted and dark
						thoughts, feelings and desires. The effect of sincere and steadfast Gayatri Sadhana is swift and
						miraculous in purifying, harmonizing and steadying the mind and thus establishing unshakable
						inner peace and a sense of joy-filled calm even in the face of grave trials and tribulations in
						the outer life of the Sadhak. Once Gayatri Sadhana has been started, the mind is slowly and
						steadily attracted towards it and if, for some reason, it is given up by the Sadhak, a keen
						desire to resume Sadhana again repeatedly surges up in his mind. After tasting some delicious
						dish once, a person desires to savour it again and again. In the same way, spiritual food is as
						sweet as nectar and is so tasteful that the soul insists on, craves for and cries repeatedly to
						get it. It never results in any distress, calamity or hardship. It may be that due to certain
						omissions or mistakes, one may not get the expected benefits but there is not the least doubt
						that even little of Sadhana does not go in vain.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p><strong>Who should do </strong><strong>Gayatri</strong><strong>&nbsp;Yagya and Puja?</strong></p>

					<p>Gayatri is the mother of the Vedas and the destroyer of sins. There is nothing more purifying on
						the earth as well as in heaven than the Gayatri. The chant of Gayatri brings the same fruit as
						the recitation of all four Vedas together with the Angas. Gayatri destroys the three kinds of
						Taapa or pain. Gayatri bestows the four kinds of Purushartha viz. Dharma (righteousness), Artha
						(wealth), Kama (desired objects) and Moksha (liberation or freedom). It destroys the three
						Granthis or knots of ignorance, Avidya, Kama and Karma. Gayatri purifies the mind. Gayatri
						bestows Ashta Siddhis. Gayatri makes a man powerful and highly intelligent. Gayatri eventually
						gives liberation or emancipation from the wheel of births and deaths so anyone who wants peace,
						prosperity and wealth in life can get it performed.</p>

					<p><strong>Benefits of</strong> <strong>Gayatri Gayatri</strong><strong> Yagya and Puja.</strong>
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Chanting of Gayatri Mantra has many health benefits. Chanting of the Gayatri Mantra is one
							of the longer parts of Hindu traditions, and it is one of the most important mantras
							compared to other mantras. Diwali is a colourful festival celebrated as a symbol of success
							of light over darkness and you can rectify this situation by chanting the very religious
							Gayatri Mantra.</li>
						<li><strong>calms the mind</strong></li>
						<li>Start chanting Gayatri Mantra with Om. The first advantage of chanting this mantra is that
							it calms the mind. Chanting Om helps in releasing the relaxation hormone. The relaxation
							hormone means the happy hormone, serotonin, and it makes you feel positive.</li>
						<li><strong>Enhances concentration and learning</strong></li>
						<li>The person who chants Gayatri Mantra, that person gets concentration and the ability to
							learn. This is the reason why when you chant Gayatri Mantra the conclusion vibration starts
							the three chakras present mainly on your face, head and third eye, throat and crown chakras.
							In</li>
						<li>The three chakras help increase concentration because they connect directly to the brain and
							coronet chakras, eyes, sinuses, lower head, pituitary gland and thyroid gland. When the
							vibration<strong> is </strong>conducted it helps to refresh the respective glands and it
							improves concentration and focus.</li>
						<li><strong>improves your breathing</strong></li>
						<li>While chanting Gayatri Mantra you need to take big breaths and manage the breaths which when
							done normally help in upgrading your lung function and breathing. Apart from excessive
							breathing, it also helps in supplying oxygen to the whole body, thereby keeping you healthy.
						</li>
						<li><strong>Helpful in keeping the heart healthy</strong></li>
						<li>The person&#39;s breathing automatically slows down by chanting the mantra. This will help
							synchronize and standardize your heartbeat. And it helps to stay healthy.</li>
