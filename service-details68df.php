						&nbsp;Akshaya Tritiya Special Yagya</h2>

					<p>Akshaya Tritiya is called Tritiya Tithi of Shukla Paksha in Vaishakh month. According to
						mythological texts, whatever auspicious work is done on this day, they get eternal results. For
						this reason it is called Akshaya Tritiya. Although Shukla Pakshi Tritiya of all the twelve
						months is auspicious, but the date of Vaishakh month is considered one of the self-evident
						Muhurtas. On this day, without seeing any calendar, any auspicious work related to
						house-warming, purchase of clothes-jewellery or purchase of house, vehicle etc. can be done.
						Wearing new clothes, jewelery etc. and establishing or inaugurating a new institution, society
						etc. is considered auspicious on this day. On this day, any puja, yagya, donation, chanting,
						home, has inexhaustible benefits. Akshay means never decaying. On this day, by taking bath in
						Ganga and performing Yagya Puja, all sins are destroyed. On this day, if we humans sincerely
						pray to God for forgiveness for the crimes committed by ourselves or our relatives, knowingly or
						unknowingly, then God forgives our crimes and bestows upon us virtues. Therefore, on this day,
						we surrender our bad qualities at the feet of God. There is also a tradition of offering it to
						him forever and asking for the boon of good qualities.</p>

						Tritiya. All of you must participate in this Yagya on this auspicious occasion of Akshaya
						Tritiya. Many such sins and bad deeds are committed by us knowingly and unknowingly, to get rid
						of them all we must perform Yagya ritual on Akshaya Tritiya.&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Akshaya Tritiya is said to the most auspicious day of the year. Any charity or good act
						performed, or gold purchased or puja conducted on this day never diminishes and continues to
