					<p><strong>Mangal dosh yagya &amp; puja.</strong></p>

					<p>Mangal dosha is also known as Manglik dosha or Kuja dosha. Mangal dosha is associated with the
						planet Mars. If Mars is placed in the 1st, 4th, 7th, 8th or 12th house in a native&#39;s birth
						chart it is called Mangal or Manglik Dosha, as Mars is considered malefic if mentioned Kept in
						any of the houses. Since Mars is considered the planet of war, it creates unfavourable
						conditions for marriage.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>If a person is under the influence of Mangal
						Dosha then his marriage may get delayed. Marital life is very chaotic and there is constant
						animosity, differences, lack of understanding and trust issues between the partners. The native
						may face health-related problems, there may be constant financial problems and the person may be
						very bad-tempered.</p>

					<p><strong>Who should do mangal dosh &nbsp;Yagya and Puja?</strong></p>

					<p>When Mars Dosha Yoga is being formed in your horoscope, then this Yagya should be ordered. There
						may be many other problems as well regarding Health, Wealth and overall Happiness. However the
						most prominent problem due to this Manglik Dosha Shanti Puja is related to marriage and unless
						this Dosha is rectified by getting a proper Manglik Dosha Shanti Puja performed, it is almost
						impossible for the person to lead a happy or normal life.</p>

					<p>It is a well-known fact that this Dosh becomes the primary reason for the delay in the marriage
						of affected individuals and it creates lots of disturbances. Its negative effects may cause the
						death of spouse after marriage, which can be the worst case for anyone. Additionally, it is also
						recommended that a person having a Manglik Dosha Shanti Puja should only marry a Manglik person
						as this leads to cancellation or reduction of the malefic effects of Manglik Dosh.</p>

					<p>Basically, Mars is the planet of power, courage, strength, and aggression and as per astrology,
						it is seen as a cruel planet too. Mangal or Mars is often explained with a red body that
						exemplifies the natural colour of the astronomical body in the sky. Significance of Mars is
