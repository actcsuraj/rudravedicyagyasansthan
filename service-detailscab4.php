					<p><strong>&nbsp;Navgrah shanti yagya &amp; puja</strong></p>

					<p>Navagraha Yagya is done to strengthen the planets, which affect a particular area of
						​​life.&nbsp; In which there is relief in planetary peace and negative effects.&nbsp; All the
						planets in this Yagya include Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu, and Ketu
						Yagya, and all help in getting rid of the negative effects and increase the positive
						effects.&nbsp; We perform the Navagraha Yagya to convert the negative effects of the planets
						into positive forms.&nbsp; Navagraha Yagya increases the positive effects of planets which
						brings compatibility in dasha and transit.</p>

					<p><strong>WHO SHOULD DO Navgrah Shanti&nbsp;YAGYA PUJA?</strong></p>

					<p>&nbsp;Navagraha Yagya helps in various aspects of our life so that present desires can be
						manifested more easily and special (Vedic) mantras are used to strengthen the positive effects
						of the planets and to remove the negative effects. Therefore, this yagya is helpful for your
						success in all areas of your life and helps you live a balanced life.&nbsp; This yagya is
						recommended before any special yagya request.&nbsp; The peace of the planets which affects our
						life is done by planetary peace, and we always move towards success in our work.&nbsp; Helps
						release the hold of the Navagraha, and frees us for greater success.<br />
						<br />
						&nbsp;
					</p>

					<p>&nbsp;<strong>Remove the danger that has not come up yet: -</strong></p>

					<p>&nbsp;We all know that the best protection is prevention.&nbsp; A planetary Peace yagya helps us
						to free the grip of the planet, to free us for greater success.&nbsp; Economic effects change
						with cycles of time.&nbsp; The effect may be short or long, hidden or obvious, and develop
						suddenly or slowly.&nbsp; Planets constantly affect us, such as a stream of water flowing
						through a pipeline.&nbsp; The Graha Shanti Yagya acts like a water filter to purify that
						effect.&nbsp; If the water is quite polluted, you need to change the filter more often.&nbsp; If
						you want a particularly high quality of water, then you should use a strong filter. &nbsp;This
						yagya is performed for each of the nine planets used in Vedic astrology.&nbsp; Planets always
						affect our lives.&nbsp; This is why we strongly recommend everyone participate in the planetary
						yajna before ordering any yagya.&nbsp; We Vedic astrologers read your life first, after checking
						it, they give you advice on the necessary planetary yagya or Yagya. &nbsp;This Yagya should be
						done from time to time according to their life reading.&nbsp; We highly recommend the Navagraha
						Yagya.</p>
