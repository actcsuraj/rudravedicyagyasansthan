						<h3><a href="javascript:void(0)">What is Yagya? What is Vedic Yagya?</a></h3>
						<p>(Vedic) Yagya is a spiritual practice.Is a blissful and divine action performed by a
							group of Vedic Vedacharyas, who sit together, and recite mantras and chant Vedic verses.
							(Vedic Vedacharyas: - scholars of Vedas)
							This auspicious activity is performed with a very pure mind, deep meditation, purity of
							thoughts and body. Yagya has its origin in the Sanskrit word.
							The word Yagya is derived from the Yaj Dhatu of Sanskrit.
							Yaj Dhatu is recited, which means devotion, compatibility and charity. Yagyas are
							performed not only for themselves but for the entire world welfare. In which the gods
							are worshiped, it is called Yagya.</p>
						<p> The work in which the deities are worshiped and contented is called Yagya. The ritual in
							which rituals should be performed for the deities is called Yagya.The rituals or Yagya
							are from the Vedic era. Yagya is discussed in detail in the Vedas. The Vedas are four.
							There are 1131 branches of the four Vedas, among them (Yagya) karmakanda Upasanakanda
							and gyanakanda are divided into three Kandas. The number of mantras in the Vedas is one
							lakh. There are 80 thousand karmakand (yagya), 16 thousand in Upasanakanda and 4
							thousand Mantras of gyanakanda. From this point of view the ritual part is predominant
							in the Vedas. </p>

						<h3><a href="javascript:void(0)">Why is it called Yagya?</a></h3>
						<p> The deeds in which people pray for food, rain, prosperity. The gods pray to Haviki from
							the Yajaman, and the Karmoko Yajna is the one in which the mantras are predominant.Yajna
							is the Karma-particular in which the deity, the lavya dravya, Vedamantra, (Ritvija means
							vedic Vedacharyas) Ritvija and Dakshina - the combination of these five.In the first mantra
							Agnimidae Purohitam of the Rigveda, the post of Yagya has come, so it is proved that the
							Veda and Yagya are related. Now we quote the words of many sage-maharishis, from which
							the significance of yagya will be introduced beautifully.</p>
						<p> Deities and ancestors survive through the yagya. All humans live under the gods, and all
							the gods live under the sacrificial fire. Yagya is Lord Vishnu, Vishnu remains the most
							revered in God. Gods and Oushadis have been created for the Yagya. Shiva created humans
							for the yajna and said to them - Yagya is the welfare of all, so be ready in the yagya.
							The great Mahatma men go to heaven through the yagya and are worshiped well by the gods,
							and the virtuous men of the yagya go to heaven and receive a variety of pleasures.
							Therefore, one should worship God with great effort.</p>
						<p>Brahma has created many kinds of wealth for the Yagya itself. Only Yajnist men are able
							to protect everyone. Therefore Yagya is the ultimate useful wealth of all. Only after
							the yagya are written the use of meaning, work etc. One who donates and yagya is the
							king. In the three worlds there are no more good things of Yagya. Therefore, a man
							should be yagya without deviation.The wise Vipra who always performs the best yagya, he
							attains heaven through the path of the divine under the influence of yagya.</p>

						<h3><a href="javascript:void(0)">Yajnarthatkarmaṇon'yatra lokoyam karmabandhanaḥ. </a></h3>
						<p>(That is, all the actions of human beings should be done for yagya. In this way, all the
							sacraments of the religion of the human being can be yagya , provided they are based on
							the Vedadi scriptures, not inspired by mastery. Yagyas that are compatible with the
							scriptures are fruitful and important. Lord Rama's whole life was yagya and today we
							worship him as an ideal and revered god. Similarly, the life of Lord Krishna was also
							yagya, which is why today we perform his yajna as a worshiper of Lord Yagya. It is clear
							in this way that just as Lord Rama and Krishna spent their lives yagya fire, similarly,
							we should also spend our whole life yagya our lives.</p>
						<p> Yagya is done to remove all the human beings' deprivations and obstacles. Where has it
							been in the Yajurveda that the one who renounces the yagya, renounces the divine. Yagya
							has been said to make everyone workable and the ladder to heaven, not only that through
							the use of yagya it is possible to interview the soul and attain God. Yagya is the
							original symbol of Indian culture. </p>
						<p>In the scriptures, Gayatri is considered to be the mother and Yagya as the father, due to
							the combination of these two, the second birth of man is the spiritual birth. Humans are
							born in the form of a body through their parents, all are born. But by spiritual
							conversion, one gets a spiritual birth i.e. another birth. Physical birth is an excuse
							to come into the world. But the real birth is the same when a person awakens his
							conscience, whose medium is a Yagya.</p>
						<p>The effect of Yagya varies from people to people. It depends on their karma and planetary
							conditions. If the person's karma is good, the effect of the Yagya will last for a long
							time. If there is no effect of Yagya, it is necessary to participate in yajna again.
							Yagya is a symbol of collectivity. Other worships or religious practices are those which
							one can do or do alone; But Yagya is such a task, which requires the cooperation of more
							people. </p>

						<h3><a href="javascript:void(0)">What is Vedic Havan?</a></h3>
						<p>Vedic Havan is the main part of the Yagya. Havan is a ritual ritual of purification, also
							known as Yagya. There is a process of worshiping God through fire in the Kunda. Hava
							Hividravya and Havishya are the substances that are yagya in the fire. Agni increases
							the properties of any substance manifold. Drugs produced during incense in fire, smoke
							purifies the environment by destroying harmful bacteria. Due to which the possibility of
							spreading the disease is greatly reduced.</p>
						<p> Yagya is also called Agni Hotra. Agni is the main deity of the yagay fire. Havan
							material is given in the mouth of fire. It is Agnihotra to worship God with close
							proximity to Agnirupi. By experiencing the closeness of the fiery God, one should also
							hold his qualities inside himself. The nature of fire is warm, which is attained in our
							thoughts and actions.</p>
