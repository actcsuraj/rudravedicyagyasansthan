					<p><strong>Chaitra Navratri Vedic Homa Yagya.&nbsp;</strong></p>

					<p>Vasant Navratri of Chaitra Navratri is an important festival which has great significance in
						Indian culture. During this Navratri, people worship Goddess Durga and her nine forms for
						nine days. On this occasion, people keep fast, perform puja and pray for the blessings of
						Goddess Durga. The importance of Vasant Navratri is also very high because its time falls in
						the spring season, which is the time of new beginning of the creation. At this time, new
						plants revive in nature and the entire creation gets new life. Along with this, Ram Navami
						is also celebrated during Vasant Navratri, which is the birthday of Lord Ram. That&#39;s why
						some people also know it by the name of Ram Navami.</p>

					<p>Through this holy festival, blessings of Goddess Durga, happiness, prosperity, health and
						complete well-being are sought.</p>

					<p>On this auspicious occasion, we will organize Vedic Homa and Yagya which will be a wonderful
						and supernatural experience for the people participating in this Yagya. Worshiping Maa
						Vishalakshi Ji, one of the 51 Shaktipeeth located in the Kashi pilgrimage area, is also an
						act of great virtue. We wish you all the best for participating in this holy puja. May we
						all be blessed with prosperity, happiness, respect and love from the cultural and religious
						experiences shared with the family on this great occasion.</p>

					<p><strong>Yagya homa &nbsp;performing date 17 April 2024.&nbsp;</strong></p>
