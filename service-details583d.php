					<p><strong>Rudrabhishek yagya &amp; puja.</strong></p>

					<p>Literal meaning, Rudra is another name for Lord Shiva. Rudrabhishek Yagya means, the Ritual bath
						(Abhishek) of the Shiva Lingam. Shiva Lingam is very important as it denotes Lord Shiva. It
						makes Lord Shiva happy as he is the most innocent and sacrificing God and he is a giver of love,
						marriage, happiness, prosperity, power, and enlightenment. Rudrabhishek Yagya is the most
						important, biggest and most popular ceremony to please Lord Shiva. It can be done for more than
						200 reasons, from health to accident, from wealth to prosperity, from marriage to winning a
						court case.</p>

						their external environment. This Yagya wards off enemies as well as physical pains; We&nbsp;take
						very special care in performing this Yagya. We take utmost care for a selection of places, from
						where the clay of Shiv Lingam is to be taken, to the selection of fruit, leaves and flowers, and
						ultimately the place and time for Visarjan of Shiva Lingam. The result of this Yagya can be best
						derived when it is performed on Pradosh days or Shivartri days. Our special Panditas and
						Aacharayas, who are working under the ingenious guidance of Astrologer Saurabh Kumar Pandey are
						specialized in this Yagya.</p>
