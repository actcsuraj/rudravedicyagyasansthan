					<p><strong>Baglamukhi &nbsp;yagya &amp; puja.</strong></p>

					<p>Baglamukhi also referred to as the &ldquo;Goddess who paralyzes enemies&rdquo; is the 8th Goddess
						of the Das Mahavidyas in Hinduism.&nbsp;The word Bagala is driven from the word Valga (meaning -
						to rein in/bridle) Mukhi (meaning the mouth) hence having the power to silence/paralyze the
						enemies. This goddess is associated with the golden/yellow and hence also called
						&ldquo;Pitambari&rdquo;</p>

					<p><strong>Who should do baglamukhi &nbsp;&nbsp;Yagya and Puja?</strong></p>

					<p>&quot;Baglamukhi&quot; is derived from &quot;bagala&quot; (a distortion of the original Sanskrit
						root &quot;valga&quot;) and &quot;mukhi&quot;, meaning &quot;bridle&quot; and &quot;face&quot;,
						respectively. Thus, the name means one whose face is captured or controlled. She thus represents
						the hypnotic power of the goddess. In another interpretation, her name is translated as
						&quot;crane-faced&quot;. The colour of Baglamukhi Puja is golden and her dress is yellow. He is
						seated on a golden throne amidst an ocean of nectar filled with yellow lotus. A crescent moon
						adorns his head. Two descriptions of the goddess are found in various texts&mdash;Dwi-bhuj (two
						hands), and Chaturbhuj (four hands). Bi-sided depigmentation is more common, and is described as
						a mild or mild form. She holds a club in her right hand with which she beats a demon while
						sticking out her tongue with her left hand. This image is sometimes interpreted as an exhibition
						of sambhar (baglamukhi worship), which has the power to silence or paralyze the enemy. This is
						one of the boons for which Baglamukhi devotees worship her. Other Mahavidya goddesses are also
						said to represent similar powers useful for defeating enemies, which their worshipers invoke
						through various rituals. Baglamukhi Puja is also called Pitambara Devi or Brahmastra Rupini and
						she turns everything into its opposite. It turns speech into silence, knowledge into ignorance,
						power into impotence and defeat into victory. She represents the knowledge by which everything
						becomes opposite over time. As the stationary point between dualities, she allows us to master
						them. Seeing failure hidden in success, death hidden in life or happiness hidden in misery are
						ways of approaching reality. Baglamukhi worship is the secret presence of the opposite in which
						everything dissolves back into the unborn and the uncreated.</p>
