					<h2><strong>Shukra Yagya Puja.</strong></h2>

					<p>&nbsp;Venus is one of the beneficent planets. &nbsp;It represents Poorva Phalguni, Purvashadha
						and Bharani Nakshatra, the lord of Taurus and Libra. &nbsp;Venus is the female factor, which
						holds the qualities of Aishwarya and happiness. &nbsp;The exalted Venus of Pisces is the low of
						Virgo. &nbsp;The friendly planets are Mercury and Saturn. &nbsp;It sees the seventh house with a
						complete vision from its place. &nbsp;Venus travels in one zodiac for 1 month, its dasha year is
						20.<br />
						&nbsp;</p>

					<h2><strong>&nbsp;Who should do Shukra Yagya Puja?</strong></h2>

					<p>&nbsp;When Venus does not give us favourable results, and when Venus obstructs a particular area
						in the horoscope, Venus suggests peace sacrifice. &nbsp;Shukra Shanti Yagya is performed to
						remove the obstacles and areas affected by the planet Venus. &nbsp;Venus represents fertility
						(literally semen), delightful material pleasures. &nbsp;Venus represents everything that is
						directly and indirectly related to human reproduction: marriage, sex, harmony, comfort, luxury,
						pleasure and beauty. &nbsp;The position of Venus in the horoscope gives the ability to
						experience harmonious and romantic relationships. &nbsp;Our five senses are ruled by Venus.
						&nbsp;It&#39;s alluring, sensual. &nbsp;Physically it controls the private part, kidney, and
						semen. &nbsp;Weak Venus gives diseases of the bladder, sex organs, and vascular during
						pollination. &nbsp;Venus life partner, extramarital affairs, sex, puberty, comfort, happiness,
						poetic ability, ability to dance, movies and TV, media etc. &nbsp;Venus will also affect
						one&#39;s writing skills, harmony and cleanliness or happiness. &nbsp;A person with very weak
						Venus suffers from excessive drinking, diabetes, friability, impotence, sexually transmitted
						diseases, devoid of sexual pleasure, kidney problems and diseases caused by low sperm count.
						&nbsp;Auspicious Venus gives successful artists, an interest in art, happy life, luxurious life,
						an attraction towards the opposite sex, happy career etc. &nbsp;Inauspicious Venus gives the
						absence of sexual pain, lack of youthful pleasure, immoral character, excessive drinking, loss
						of children, separation. &nbsp;Mental debility from a life partner, loss of money, loss of
						reputation etc. &nbsp;Writing skill, harmony and cleanliness or happiness. &nbsp;A person with
